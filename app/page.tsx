        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I think the act of programming is sublime.
          It is the process of expressing an idea under the engineering system constraints, while optimizing for a weighted combination of performance, simplicity, scalability, and development time.
          I go through this process to create apps and websites with responsive user experiences and backend systems that are fast and reliable.

        <p>
          Outside of my work, you can find me planning my next Path of Exile build, or hiking in Shenendoah listening to a sci-fi/fantasy audiobook.
