          <p>
            I think programming is sublime.
            It is the process of expressing an idea using the tools offered by the system, while optimizing for a weighted combination of performance, simplicity, scalability, and development time.
            I iterate through this process to create apps and websites with <span className="attention">responsive user experiences</span> and backend systems that are <span className="attention">fast</span> and <span className="attention">reliable</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of my work, you can find me planning my next Path of Exile build, or hiking in Shenandoah while listening to a sci-fi/fantasy audiobook.
